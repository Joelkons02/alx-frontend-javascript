## Overview

Welcome to the ES6 Classes project! In this project, you will dive into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript using ES6 classes. You will learn how to define classes, add methods, work with static methods, extend classes, and explore metaprogramming and symbols.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Define a Class in JavaScript.
- Add methods to a class to encapsulate behavior.
- Understand the purpose and usage of static methods in classes.
- Extend a class from another to create a class hierarchy.
- Explore the concepts of metaprogramming and symbols in JavaScript.

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Node.js 12.11.x
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
