## Overview

This project is focused on teaching you about ES6 Promises in JavaScript. You will learn how to work with Promises, the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods, as well as the `await` operator and how to use async functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain what Promises are and why they are used.
- Use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods to work with Promises.
- Understand the `await` operator and how to use it in async functions.
- Write code that meets linting standards using ESLint.
- Test your code using Jest.

## Requirements

To work on this project, you will need the following:

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Node.js 12.11.x
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Setup

1. Install Node.js 12.11.x:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
Verify the installation:
bash
Copy code
nodejs -v
# Should output: v12.11.1

npm -v
# Should output: 6.11.3
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

## Install Jest, Babel, and ESLint by running:


Copy code
npm install
